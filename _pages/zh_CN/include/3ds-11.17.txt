**3DS firmware 11.17.0 was recently released**. 以下是一些你应该知道的事情：

- If your device is running *Luma 10.2.1 or higher*, it is *100% safe* to update. 你可以在关机状态下按住 SELECT 键，然后按下电源键开机以检查主机的 Luma 版本。
- If your device is on an older Luma version, you should [update Luma](checking-for-cfw) before you update your device to 11.17.0.
- If your device does not yet have custom firmware, **do NOT update to the latest version**, as installation methods may be more difficult.
- If your unmodified device is ALREADY on 11.17.0, this guide has been updated accordingly. Specifically, New3DS-family devices have a [free software method](homebrew-launcher-(super-skaterhax)), while Old3DS-family devices will need to use [alternate exploits](alternate-exploits) that rely on external hardware or software.
